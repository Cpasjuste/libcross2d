cross2d
-------

- a c++ cross platform 2d graphic, input and audio library
- currently run on Linux, Switch, 3DS and PS Vita
- quickly prototype your application on desktop (Linux)
- use hardware acceleration on Linux, Switch, 3DS and PS Vita
- use some of the great [sfml](https://www.sfml-dev.org/) library stuff (fonts, shapes, matrices) 
- use [tweeny](https://github.com/mobius3/tweeny) for the (minimal) tween engine
- use some of the great [libretro](https://github.com/libretro/glsl-shaders) shaders (Linux, Switch)
- preliminary developed for my own use, but could now probably be used to ease development 
- is still a work in progress
